All the art you find on this website is under a Creative Commons Attribution License. This means that you may copy, distribute, display and perform the artwork and make derivative works based on it as long as you give me credit.
Credit is as simple and easy as a line in your “about” page on the app you use the art for saying “Art: Vicki Wenderlich” or something similar. I’d love a link to my website as well, but that’s up to you!
You may not sell the actual art by itself, but you may use the art in an app that you publish on the app store, even if the app is not free.
Thanks, I appreciate it!
